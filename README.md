The reason I chose the MiT License for my repository is because it is a basic license and is very open and clear.
It is short and simple license that only requires the preservation of copyright and license notices.  It lets anyone
do anything with my code as long as the provide attribution back to me and don't hold me liable for anything that
they decide to do with it.  The license works well for commercial use and well as private use and is useful for distribution
and modification.  I also chose this license because it allows me the ability to sell the software if I choose to and I am
also not compelled to provide the source code, therefore it gives me comfort knowing that it is still my own code.
